# H1 MEE 381 First Coding Assingment
For this code, we were required to select two tasks, one from each group provided. From group A, I chose to do the first question: Which is Faster: Adding two floats together, or two doubles?
This code created an interesting challenge of converting two randomly generated floats to doubles. Had the code required us to simply generate two random floats and two random doubles, the code
would have been much easier. However, it was not too difficult at all and I understand that having two different sums might affect the computer's ability to complete the math in the same time.
When creating this code, I had expected the computer would have been able to add two floats together more quickly than two doubles due to the size of each one. This did not turn out to be true, however, 
and the float was actually slower to calculate than the double. For the second part of the project, I selected the first option from group B: Which is Faster: computing the square of a double via
direct multiplication or computing the square using the the built in function Math.Pow function. Also compare these to the built in square root function: Math.sqrt function. I would expect the 
time to calculate the square of a double to be the shortest amount of time due to the fact it is direct multiplication and the computer does not need to call a funtion. This turned out to be true 
but just barely over the Math.Sqrt Value.
